A progressive web app built with Ionic 2 that uses SqlStorage and a manifest to provide offline, persistent storage.

## API Reference


A progressive web application for managing sales leads built using Ionic, Angular 2, and Typescript. Leads are able to be edited or deleted from the list view and are managed using SqlStorage.  The settings tab allows for marking all leads as new (on/off) and setting static fields to accompany each lead.  Leads will then periodically be pushed to an API endpoint for storage/collaboration in the cloud.
